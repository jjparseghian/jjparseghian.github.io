description: Web-based solver for "connect the dots". Users will be able to take one of 2 actions. (1) They can click on the "Solve" button to solve the current connect-the-dots puzzle. (2) They can click elsewhere on the page (anywhere outside of the "Solve" button) to add an additional dot to the page. The challenge here was to draw N dots and N lines to connect them, without any of the lines intersecting.
